  <h3>Fire</h3>
  <p>With fire we consume and exhume, christened with heat that we lost in the womb. With fire we dance, we prance and we sing. Fire is a wonderful thing.</p>
  <h3>Love</h3>
  <p>Hearts in battle, in our chests they rattle, stuck in a cage, related to rage. With love we run, with love we hide. With love we hate, with love we relate. A frozen pond, or a concrete lake. We sing a song, of loving mates. Feel the tune, and
    don't leave soon. Unpack your bags, stay here with me. We might see what we can be.</p>
